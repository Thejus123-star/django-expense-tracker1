##README.md

Expense Tracker is a web-based application developed using **Django** and **Tailwind CSS**.
The purpose of this project is to help users manage their daily expenses efficiently through a simple and user-friendly interface. The system allows users to register, log in securely, add new expenses, view their expense history, filter records by category, and track their total spending using a modern dashboard.

The application follows Django’s Model–View–Template architecture and uses SQLite as the database. User authentication is handled using Django’s built-in authentication system, ensuring data security and proper session management.

### Features

The system provides secure user registration and login functionality. Users can add, update, and delete expense records. Each expense is stored with a title, amount, category, and date. The dashboard displays total expenses and the number of entries. Expenses can also be filtered by category for easy tracking. The interface is fully responsive and styled with a premium yellow/gold theme using Tailwind CSS.

### Technologies Used

The backend of the application is built with Python using the Django framework.
The frontend is designed with HTML and Tailwind CSS.
The database used is SQLite.
User authentication is managed by Django’s built-in authentication system.



## How to Run the Server

To run the project, the virtual environment must first be activated. Django should then be installed, and database migrations should be applied. After this, the server is started using the command:


python manage.py runserver


Once the server is running, the application can be accessed in a web browser by opening the following address:
